Online Shopping

## Startup instructions

Open a chromium based browser (as these are the only ones tested) and go to https://daxtery.github.io/interfaces/

## Briefing

During these troubled times the need for online shopping has risen. Even in times outside these, online shopping was still used because it
is faster than physically going to the shop, as well being more convenient in the way that you can make the purchase whenever you like.
Some shops have adopted and have created some online shops. However, these can have some issues with the interface, namely being too
confusing, not displaying all the information or even being too hard.

## Scenarios

### Scenario 1

**Description**: We want to find a particular product: `chicken noodle soup`. It has to be of the `Campbell` brand.

### Scenario 2

**Description**: We want to buy `light milk`, but we don't want to spend a lot, so we'll go with the `cheapest per L`. Once we've found it, we should add it to the cart.

### Scenario 3

**Description**: We want to see the cart.

### Scenario 4

**Description**: We want to remove a product from the cart.

### Scenario 5

**Description**: We want to add a product to the cart.

### Scenario 6

**Description**: We should be able to checkout, finishing our order.


## Incomplete

- The results from a search (either by category or by the search bar) still need to be paginated.

- The results from a search (either by category or by the search bar) still need to be able to be ordered: by `popularity`, `unit price`, `price per kg/l`, `quantity kg/l`. Any combination of these either ascending or descending.

- The checkout part still has no interface.

- Clicking an item still doesn't do anything. It should open a dialog where more details are shown.
